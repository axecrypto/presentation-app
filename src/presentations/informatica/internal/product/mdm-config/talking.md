Talking Points for "What We Deliver in Under 1 Hour"

  Opening Hook

  "Let me show you exactly what you get in less than 60 minutes - something that traditionally takes 16-24 
  weeks."

  For Each Deliverable Box:

  1. AI Model Discovery
  "Our AI analyzes your business requirements and automatically matches them to pre-built MDM models. No 
  more manual mapping spreadsheets or workshops. We've seen 70% faster setup because the AI already knows 
  which model fits your customer, product, or supplier data."

  2. IDMC Integration Services
  "This is key - we're not replacing your Informatica investment. We're supercharging it. Our AI 
  orchestrates IDMC agents to automatically configure data quality rules, ETL jobs, and integration 
  mappings. You get the full power of IDMC, configured instantly."

  3. Match & Merge Logic
  "The AI generates intelligent matching rules based on your data patterns. It's not generic - it learns 
  from your specific data characteristics. 95% accuracy out of the box, compared to weeks of manual rule 
  writing."

  4. User Interfaces
  "Data steward screens are auto-generated and ready to use. No UI development needed. Your business users 
  can start working immediately - search, edit, approve records - it's all there."

  5. Sample Data
  "Here's what executives love - realistic test data for immediate demos. 10,000+ records that look like 
  your real data. You can show a working system today, not mockups."

  6. Complete Package
  "Everything exports as a production-ready configuration. Import into your IDMC environment and you're 
  done. No missing pieces, no additional development."

  Process Timeline Talking Points

  "Notice the 7-step flow at the bottom. This isn't sequential - our AI agents work in parallel. While one 
  agent discovers models, another profiles your data, another generates rules. That's how we compress 
  months into minutes."

  Closing Impact

  "Look at these numbers: 99% time saved, 100% automated, demo-ready on day one. This isn't about working 
  faster - it's about working differently. Your MDM program can deliver value in the first week, not the 
  first year."
