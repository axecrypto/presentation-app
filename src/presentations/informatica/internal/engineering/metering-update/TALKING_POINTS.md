# Metering Platform Update - Talking Points

## Slide 1: Title
**Duration: 30 seconds**

"Today we're going to talk about something critical that's been on everyone's radar - the metering platform initiative. This is our path to understanding and monetizing customer usage."

## Slide 2: The Problem
**Duration: 90 seconds**

"Let me be blunt - we have zero visibility into customer usage. Zero."

- **Can't Price Appropriately**: "Heavy users pay the same as light users. It's like if AWS charged the same whether you use 1 server or 1000 servers."

- **Can't Optimize Resources**: "We're scaling blind. We don't know which services are overprovisioned or underprovisioned."

- **Can't Help Customers**: "Customers increasingly ask 'how much am I using?' and we literally can't answer them. It's embarrassing and frustrating for everyone."

"Every day without metering is revenue lost and customers frustrated."

## Slide 3: The Opportunity
**Duration: 60 seconds**

"The good news? This is a solved problem in the industry."

- **20% Revenue Uplift**: "Companies that implement usage-based pricing see an average 20% revenue increase. This isn't theoretical - it's proven."

- **For us**: "On a $100M business, even a conservative 2-3% uplift would justify the entire investment."

- **Immediate Value**: "But we don't have to wait for revenue. Day 1, we get internal visibility to optimize costs and improve service."

"This isn't about building something new - it's about catching up to where the market already is."

## Slide 4: Where We Are
**Duration: 90 seconds**

"So where do we stand today?"

- **What's Working**: "Leadership gets it. We have buy-in. The business case is clear. We know what meters we need."

- **What's In Progress**: "Some teams have built partial solutions. But it's fragmented - different approaches, no standards."

- **What's Missing**: "Platform adoption. IDMC has metering capabilities, but our services aren't plugged in. We need a dedicated team to drive this integration."

"The platform exists. We just need to connect to it."

## Slide 5: First Wave - Where We'll Start
**Duration: 90 seconds**

"We're not starting from zero. We've already identified the first services to onboard:"

- **Core APIs with Bejoy**: "CRUD operations plus Search - these are the bread and butter of our platform. High volume, clear value."

- **Match Service with Prasuna**: "Our most complex and valuable operation. This is where customers see the most value."

- **Data Flow with Ankit**: "Ingress and egress - every byte in and out. Critical for capacity planning and pricing."

"Why these first? They represent 80% of our platform traffic, have clear business impact, and most importantly - have committed PMs ready to prioritize the work."

"This isn't theoretical. We have names, we have services, we have commitment. We just need to execute."

## Slide 6: The Roadmap
**Duration: 2 minutes**

"Here's our simple 3-phase approach:" *(Click through each phase)*

- **Phase 1 - Foundation (6-9 months)**: "Connect pilot services to IDMC. Establish integration patterns. Prove the approach works."

- **Phase 2 - Scale (12-18 months)**: "Roll out to major services. Build analytics and dashboards. Deliver internal value."

- **Phase 3 - Monetize (18-24 months)**: "Enable customer visibility. Pilot usage-based pricing. Create new revenue models."

"This is a multi-year journey, but each phase delivers incremental value. We start seeing internal benefits within the first few months."

## Slide 7: Planning Sprint - Critical Decisions
**Duration: 3 minutes**

"Before we can start implementation, we need to make some critical decisions:" *(Click through weekly timeline)*

- **Week 1**: "Lock technical design. No more analysis paralysis."

- **Week 2**: "Prioritize services. Focus on revenue drivers first."

- **Week 3**: "UX prototypes. Get feedback early."

- **Week 4**: "Align resources and kick off implementation."

"These 5 critical decisions must be made before we can start building. They're the foundation everything else depends on."

## Slide 8: What We Need
**Duration: 2 minutes**

"Let me be clear about what success requires:"

- **People**: "A dedicated team with clear ownership. This can't be a side project - it needs focused attention."

- **Executive Sponsorship**: "This touches every team. We need you to make it a priority."

- **Process Changes**: "Every new service must include metering from day one. No exceptions."

"Yes, it's an investment. But the return is proven and significant."

## Slide 9: Next Steps
**Duration: 90 seconds**

"Here's what happens next:"

1. **Today**: "I need commitment on the team formation."

2. **This Week**: "Architecture review with platform leads."

3. **Next Week**: "Service prioritization with product teams."

"The clock is ticking. Every month we delay pushes our ability to capture value further out. Let's stop talking about it and start building it."

## Key Messages to Reinforce

1. **Zero Visibility = Lost Revenue**: We literally don't know how customers use our platform

2. **Industry Proven**: 20% revenue uplift is the average, not the exception

3. **Simple Path Forward**: 3 phases, clear milestones, proven approach

4. **Urgency**: Competitors have this. Customers expect this. We need this.

## Q&A Preparation

**"Why not buy a solution?"**
"We evaluated vendors. Our architecture is unique enough that build gives us 3x better ROI."

**"What if we just do partial metering?"**
"Partial visibility is like flying with one eye closed. The value comes from comprehensive coverage."

**"How confident are we in the timeline?"**
"These are realistic estimates based on the complexity of integrating with IDMC and rolling out across services. The key is to start now - every month we delay pushes everything out further."

**"What about privacy concerns?"**
"We're metering usage, not content. Think electricity meter, not security camera."

## Remember
- Keep it simple and direct
- Use analogies (AWS pricing, electricity meters, mobile data plans)
- Focus on business impact, not technical details
- Create urgency without panic
- Show confidence in the plan
