# Data Matching Executive Summary - Talking Points

## Opening Hook (15 seconds)
"Let me share a number that should concern every executive in this room: Your organization is likely wasting $15 million annually due to poor data matching. But here's the thing - most companies don't even know it's happening."

## The Hidden Problem (30 seconds)
"Look at your customer data right now. I guarantee that 25-30% contains duplicates. Same customer, different spellings. Same company, multiple entries. 

This isn't a technical glitch - it's a business crisis. When marketing sends 5 emails to the same person, when sales can't see the full customer history, when finance can't reconcile accounts - that's your data matching problem manifesting as business failure."

## The Real Cost (30 seconds)
"Let's talk real money. The average enterprise loses $15 million annually to duplicate data. How?
- Your knowledge workers spend 20% of their time - one full day per week - cleaning up data messes
- You're losing revenue because you can't see customer relationships
- You're risking compliance fines because you can't accurately respond to data requests

For a billion-dollar company, we're talking about 1.5% of revenue evaporating due to bad matching."

## The Growing Risk (30 seconds)
"And it's getting worse. GDPR says 'right to be forgotten' - but how can you forget someone who exists 7 times in your systems? CCPA demands data accuracy - try explaining why you have 5 different addresses for the same customer.

Every merger, every new system, every digital transformation initiative - they all multiply your matching problem exponentially."

## The Opportunity (45 seconds)
"But here's the good news: This is a solved problem. Modern AI-powered matching delivers:
- 95% or better accuracy - finding matches human reviewers miss
- 80% reduction in manual effort - your team focusing on insights, not cleanup
- 6-month payback - this isn't a multi-year journey

Imagine: One golden record per customer. Perfect supplier deduplication. Products matched across all systems. That's not a dream - that's what our customers achieve every day."

## The Close (30 seconds)
"You can transform your data matching in 90 days. Not years - days. From chaos to golden records. From guesswork to precision. From apologies to competitive advantage.

The question isn't whether you need better data matching. The question is: How much longer can you afford to operate without it?"

## Objection Handlers

**"We already have data quality tools"**
"Data quality tools clean data. They don't match it. You can have perfectly clean duplicates - that's actually worse because they look legitimate."

**"Our IT team handles this"**
"If IT could solve this with current tools, they would have. This requires AI that understands context, not just rules."

**"We can't afford it"**
"You can't afford NOT to. You're already spending the money - just inefficiently on manual work and lost opportunities."

## Industry Variations
