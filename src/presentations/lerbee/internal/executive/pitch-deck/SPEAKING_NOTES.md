# LerBee Pitch Deck Speaking Notes

## Overview
- **Total Time**: 15-20 minutes (leave 10 mins for Q&A)
- **Tone**: Confident, passionate, data-driven
- **Key Theme**: "We're building the trust layer for global commerce"

---

## Slide 1: Title (30 seconds)
**Say:**
"Hi, I'm Valeria, CEO of LerBee. We're building the trust layer for global peer-to-peer commerce. Today I'll show you how we're turning online shopping from a transaction into a relationship."

**Key Points:**
- Brief intro
- Set the stage
- Create intrigue

---

## Slide 2: Customer Quote (45 seconds)
**Say:**
"This is Sarah from Texas. Like millions of shoppers, she's frustrated. She told us: 'I want quality products from real people, but online shopping feels like gambling.' This isn't just Sarah's problem - it's everyone's problem."

**Key Points:**
- Make it personal
- Create empathy
- This is universal pain

**Transition:** "Let me show you just how broken online shopping has become..."

---

## Slide 3: The Problem (60 seconds)
**Say:**
"Online shopping is broken on both sides. Buyers face fake reviews, no human connection, and cross-border friction. Sellers can't differentiate, struggle to build trust, and pay 30-50% to platforms. The result? A $7.8 trillion market built on mistrust."

**Key Points:**
- Both sides lose
- Emphasize trust crisis
- Set up for solution

**Transition:** "But what if we could fix this? What if shopping online felt like shopping from a trusted friend?"

---

## Slide 4: Market Opportunity (45 seconds)
**Say:**
"This broken trust represents a massive opportunity. The global e-commerce market is $7.8 trillion. Our addressable market in cross-border social commerce is $140 billion. We need just 0.5% of that to build a unicorn."

**Key Points:**
- TAM → SAM → SOM
- Realistic targets
- Unicorn math is simple

**Transition:** "So how do we capture this opportunity?"

---

## Slide 5: What We Do (60 seconds)
**Say:**
"LerBee is a peer-to-peer marketplace where shoppers become your personal buyers worldwide. Think of it as Uber for shopping - but instead of rides, it's products. Shoppers live-stream their shopping trips, buyers request items, and trust is built through real human connections."

**Key Points:**
- Simple analogy
- Trust through transparency
- Global reach, local expertise

**Transition:** "Let me show you exactly how it works..."

---

## Slide 6: How It Works (45 seconds)
**Say:**
"Four simple steps: First, shoppers go live from stores. Buyers request items in real-time. Shoppers purchase with their own money. Platform handles payment and shipping. It's that simple - and it's working."

**Key Points:**
- Emphasize simplicity
- Real-time interaction
- Platform handles complexity

**Transition:** "And the results speak for themselves..."

---

## Slide 7: Traction (60 seconds)
**Say:**
"In just 18 months, with minimal marketing spend: 7,800 users across 4 continents. 11 million video views. 95% repeat buyer rate. $390K in GMV. Most importantly - our LTV is already 25x our CAC."

**Key Points:**
- Built lean, scaled globally
- Retention is exceptional
- Unit economics work

**Transition:** "But numbers only tell half the story. Let me show you what this means for real people..."

---

## Slide 8: Shopper Success Story (45 seconds)
**Say:**
"Meet Vicky from Miami. She was a struggling student. Started live shopping on LerBee. Now makes $3,000 per month, built a community of 500 loyal buyers, and turned shopping into a business. We have hundreds of Vickys."

**Key Points:**
- Real transformation
- Economic empowerment
- Replicable success

**Transition:** "Vicky's not unique. Our engagement metrics prove product-market fit..."

---

## Slide 9: Product-Market Fit (60 seconds)
**Say:**
"4.7 App Store rating. 60% daily active users. Each user invites 3-5 friends. 87 NPS score. But here's the kicker - shoppers message buyers on WhatsApp to coordinate. They're building relationships outside our platform. That's true product-market fit."

**Key Points:**
- Exceptional metrics
- Organic virality
- Users hack around us

**Transition:** "And this translates into attractive economics..."

---

## Slide 10: Business Model (60 seconds)
**Say:**
"We make money simply - 12-15% take rate. CAC is $15-20, already dropping. Average transaction $180. But here's what's exciting - shoppers become buyers, buyers become shoppers. It's a virtuous cycle that drives LTV over $500."

**Key Points:**
- Simple monetization
- Improving unit economics
- Network effects

**Transition:** "We're hitting this inflection point at the perfect time..."

---

## Slide 11: Why Now (45 seconds)
**Say:**
"Four megatrends are converging: First, 64% of consumers lost trust in e-commerce. Second, AI costs dropped 90%, enabling us to scale. Third, Gen Z demands authentic shopping. Fourth, cross-border commerce is exploding. The market is ready for LerBee."

**Key Points:**
- Multiple tailwinds
- Technology enablers
- Cultural shift

**Transition:** "And here's how we use AI to scale trust..."

---

## Slide 12: AI Advantage (45 seconds)
**Say:**
"AI handles operations - translations, logistics, discovery. Humans handle relationships - taste, style, trust. This partnership means we can scale globally without losing the human touch. AI makes us efficient. Humans make us special."

**Key Points:**
- AI as enabler, not replacement
- Scale without losing soul
- Competitive moat

**Transition:** "This approach gives us a unique position in the market..."

---

## Slide 13: Competitive Landscape (60 seconds)
**Say:**
"Amazon has scale but no soul. Temu has prices but no trust. TikTok Shop has entertainment but shallow commerce. We're not competing on their terms. We're building deep, trust-based micro-communities. We don't warehouse products - we warehouse trust."

**Key Points:**
- Different game
- Trust as moat
- Community over transaction

**Transition:** "And we have the team to execute..."

---

## Slide 14: Team (45 seconds)
**Say:**
"I previously built a $50M commerce business. My co-founders bring experience from Apple, Instagram, and two successful exits. We've done this before. We're not learning on your dime - we're executing a proven playbook."

**Key Points:**
- Been there, done that
- Big tech experience
- Execution focused

**Transition:** "Here's where we're headed..."

---

## Slide 15: 2025 Forecast (60 seconds)
**Say:**
"With your investment, by end of 2025: 100,000 users, $10 million GMV run rate, CAC under $5 through viral growth. We'll expand to LATAM and India, launch referral programs, and activate network effects. Conservative projections based on current metrics."

**Key Points:**
- Specific targets
- Clear growth levers
- Achievable goals

**Transition:** "And here's our roadmap to get there..."

**Key Points:**
- Clear milestones
- Focus on growth metrics
- Path to profitability

**Transition:** "To execute this plan, we're raising..."

---

## Slide 17: Ask (60 seconds)
**Say:**
"We're raising $1-1.5 million seed round. 40% goes to product and AI to build our viral engine. 30% to growth, focusing on zero-CAC channels. 20% to team. This gets us to profitability without additional funding. We're not experimenting - we're scaling what already works."

**Key Points:**
- Specific ask
- Clear use of funds
- Path to sustainability

**Transition:** "Let me leave you with why this matters..."

---

## Slide 18: Mission (45 seconds)
