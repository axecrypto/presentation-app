## Overview
- **Total Time**: 15-20 minutes (leave 10 mins for Q&A)
- **Tone**: Confident, passionate, data-driven
- **Key Theme**: "We're building the trust layer for global commerce"
- **Structure**: 17 slides in 3 acts (Proof → Solution → Scale)

---

## Slide 1: Title (30 seconds)
**Say:**
"Hi, I'm Valeria, CEO of LerBee. We're building the trust layer for global peer-to-peer commerce. Before I tell you what we do, let me show you what we've already built."

**Key Points:**
- Brief intro
- Set expectation of proof
- Create intrigue

---

## Slide 2: Traction (60 seconds)
**Say:**
"In just 18 months, with almost no marketing spend: 7,800 users across 4 continents. 11 million video views. 95% repeat buyer rate. $390K in GMV. But here's the kicker - our CAC is $15-20 and our LTV is already over $500. We've built something people love."

**Key Points:**
- Lead with proof
- Global traction
- Unit economics work
- People love it

**Transition:** "So what problem are we solving that drives this kind of engagement?"

---

## Slide 3: The Problem (60 seconds)
**Say:**
"Online shopping is broken. Sarah from Texas told us: 'I want quality products from real people, but online shopping feels like gambling.' She's not alone. Buyers face fake reviews and no human connection. Sellers pay 30-50% fees and can't build trust. It's a $7.8 trillion market built on mistrust."

**Key Points:**
- Real customer quote
- Both sides suffer
- Massive market problem

**Transition:** "This broken trust creates a massive opportunity..."

---

## Slide 4: Market Opportunity (45 seconds)
**Say:**
"The global e-commerce market is $7.8 trillion. Cross-border social commerce - our sweet spot - is $140 billion and growing 30% annually. We need just 0.5% market share to build a unicorn. The market is massive and the timing is perfect."

**Key Points:**
- TAM → SAM → SOM
- High growth segment
- Achievable targets

**Transition:** "Here's how we're capturing this opportunity..."

---

## Slide 5: What We Do (45 seconds)
**Say:**
"LerBee is peer-to-peer live shopping. Shoppers worldwide stream their shopping trips. Buyers request products in real-time. We handle payments and logistics. Think Uber for shopping - connecting people who need products with people already shopping. Simple, human, trustworthy."

**Key Points:**
- Clear explanation
- Uber analogy
- Human-centered

**Transition:** "Let me show you exactly how it works..."

---

## Slide 6: How It Works (45 seconds)
**Say:**
"Four simple steps: Shoppers go live from stores anywhere. Buyers request items in real-time. Shoppers purchase and ship. We handle payments and trust. It's Uber for shopping - and it's already working globally."

**Key Points:**
- Dead simple process
- Real-time interaction
- We handle complexity

**Transition:** "This simplicity drives incredible results. Let me show you a real success story..."

---

## Slide 7: Shopper Success Story (45 seconds)
**Say:**
"Meet Vicky from Miami. Struggling student six months ago. Today she makes $3,000 monthly, has 500 loyal buyers, and turned shopping into a career. She's not unique - we have hundreds of Vickys building real businesses on LerBee."

**Key Points:**
- Real transformation
- Economic impact
- Scalable model

**Transition:** "The team that built this has done it before..."

---

## Slide 8: Team (45 seconds)
**Say:**
"I previously built and sold a $50M commerce business. My co-founders come from Apple, Instagram, with two successful exits between them. We're not figuring this out - we're executing a proven playbook at global scale."

**Key Points:**
- Done this before
- Big tech DNA
- Execution machines

**Transition:** "This team has created incredible product-market fit..."

---

## Slide 9: Product-Market Fit (60 seconds)
**Say:**
"The numbers speak for themselves: 4.7 App Store rating. 60% daily active users. Each user brings 3-5 friends. 87 NPS. But here's the real proof - shoppers and buyers exchange WhatsApp numbers to coordinate. They're building relationships beyond our platform."

**Key Points:**
- Best-in-class metrics
- Viral by design
- Relationships > transactions

**Transition:** "These relationships drive attractive economics..."

---

## Slide 10: Business Model (45 seconds)
**Say:**
"Simple model: 12-15% take rate. CAC just $15-20 and dropping. Average order $180. LTV over $500. The magic? Shoppers become buyers, buyers become shoppers. It's a virtuous cycle that compounds."

**Key Points:**
- Clear monetization
- 25x LTV/CAC
- Network effects

**Transition:** "We're catching multiple tailwinds..."

---

## Slide 11: Why Now (45 seconds)
**Say:**
"Four forces converging: Trust in e-commerce collapsed - 64% of shoppers worried about fakes. AI costs dropped 90% - we can now scale efficiently. Gen Z demands authentic shopping. Cross-border commerce exploding. The stars are aligned."

**Key Points:**
- Trust crisis = opportunity
- Tech enables scale
- Cultural shift

**Transition:** "Here's how AI amplifies our human network..."

---

## Slide 12: AI Advantage (45 seconds)
**Say:**
"AI handles the boring stuff - translations, routing, fraud detection. Humans do what they do best - build trust, share taste, create connections. This isn't AI replacing humans. It's AI empowering thousands of micro-entrepreneurs."

**Key Points:**
- AI enables, not replaces
- Scalable operations
- Human differentiation

**Transition:** "This creates a moat competitors can't cross..."

---

## Slide 13: Competitive Landscape (45 seconds)
**Say:**
"Amazon: scale without soul. Temu: price without trust. TikTok Shop: entertainment without depth. We play a different game - deep relationships in micro-communities. We don't compete on price. We compete on trust."

**Key Points:**
- Different playbook
- Trust is our moat
- Community wins

**Transition:** "Now let me show you how we scale..."

---

## Slide 14: 2025 Forecast (60 seconds)
**Say:**
"Conservative targets based on current metrics: 100K users by end of 2025. $10M GMV run rate. CAC under $5 through pure virality. We'll activate viral loops, expand to LATAM and India, and let network effects compound."

**Key Points:**
- Realistic growth
- Clear path to $10M
- Viral, not paid growth

**Transition:** "Here's the roadmap..."

---

## Slide 15: Roadmap (45 seconds)
**Say:**
"Three phases: Q3 2025 - nail the product with V2. H1 2026 - scale with emotional AI and new markets. H2 2026 - monetize with subscriptions and partnerships. Key metrics: viral coefficient over 1.5, $10M GMV, CAC under $5."

**Key Points:**
- Clear phases
- Growth metrics focus
- Path to profitability

**Transition:** "To execute this, we need fuel..."

---

## Slide 16: Ask (45 seconds)
**Say:**
"$1-1.5M seed round. 40% to product - building viral mechanics. 30% to growth - but organic, not ads. 20% to team. 10% operations. This gets us to cash flow positive. We're not experimenting. We're pouring gas on a fire."

**Key Points:**
- Specific use of funds
- Path to profitability
- Scaling what works

**Transition:** "But this is about more than money..."

---

## Slide 17: Mission (45 seconds)
