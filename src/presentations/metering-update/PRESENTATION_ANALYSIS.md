# Metering Platform Presentation Analysis

## Presentation Flow & Key Messages

### 1. Title Slide
**Message**: Setting the stage for a critical platform initiative

### 2. The Problem
**Key Points**:
- Zero visibility into customer usage
- Can't price appropriately
- Can't optimize resources  
- Can't help customers

**Potential Questions**:
- "How do we know we're losing money if we have zero visibility?"
- "What specific customer complaints have we received?"
- "How are other teams currently handling this?"

### 3. The Opportunity
**Key Points**:
- Industry average 20% revenue uplift
- Even 2-3% would justify investment
- Immediate operational benefits

**Potential Questions**:
- "Where does the 20% number come from?"
- "Which companies have achieved this?"
- "How long did it take them?"
- "What if we don't see these returns?"

### 4. Where We Are
**Key Points**:
- Leadership aligned (green)
- Fragmented implementation (yellow)
- No platform adoption (red)

**Potential Questions**:

### 7. What We Need
**Key Points**:
- People, Process, Investment
- Operational and Business returns

**Potential Questions**:

## Critical Questions to Prepare For

### From Product Managers:
1. "How does this impact our roadmap?"
2. "Will this slow down feature delivery?"
3. "What customer features does this enable?"
4. "How do we prioritize which services go first?"
5. "What about our existing commitments?"

### From Executives:
1. "What's the real investment needed?"
2. "What's our confidence level in the ROI?"
3. "How does this compare to other initiatives?"
4. "What are the risks?"
5. "Who's accountable for success?"
6. "What if we do nothing?"
7. "Can we buy instead of build?"
8. "How do competitors handle this?"

### Technical Questions:
1. "Why can't we just use existing tools?"
2. "How does IDMC metering actually work?"
3. "What's the integration effort per service?"
4. "How do we handle legacy services?"
5. "What about performance impact?"

## Weak Points in the Narrative

1. **Lack of Budget**: No concrete team sizes or costs
2. **Long Timeline**: 18-24 months to revenue impact may seem too distant
3. **No Quick Wins**: First phase is 6-9 months - seems long
4. **Resource Source**: "Dedicated team" but from where?
5. **Integration Effort**: How much work for each PM's team?

## Strengths

1. **Clear Problem**: Zero visibility is compelling
2. **Industry Validation**: 20% uplift is powerful if believable
3. **Phased Approach**: Shows thoughtful planning
4. **Operational Benefits**: Not just about revenue
5. **Concrete Starting Point**: Named services, PMs, and 80% coverage shows real planning

## Recommendations

1. **Add Success Metrics**: Define what success looks like at each phase
2. **Quick Win**: Identify ONE service that could be metered in 30 days
3. **Budget Range**: Even rough numbers help set expectations
4. **Risk Mitigation**: Address the "what could go wrong" question
5. **Competitive Intel**: Name companies doing this well
